/* 
The transition property in CSS is used to apply or add some transition effect on element. The transition is the combination of four properties which are listed below: 

transition-duration
transition-delay
transition-timing-function
transition-property

transition-duration: it specifies total time to complete effect.
transition-delay: It specifies the transition delay or time when transition starts.
transition-timing-function: It specifies the speed of transition.
transition-property: It specifies the CSS properties to which a transition effect should be applied.

ease -   transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear -   transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in -   transition effect with a slow start
ease-out -   transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out -   transition effect with a slow start and end.
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function 


Syntax: 
transition: transition-property transition-duration transition-timing-function transition-delay;
